## Master's Capstone Project üß¶‚ôªÔ∏è

Darn Tough, a Vermont-based sock manufacturer, strives to align its operations with the 2030 target set by its largest retailer, Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI). Specifically, this target is to achieve a 55% reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2019 baseline level by 2030. This project aims to help Darn Tough identify critical points in their supply chain, make effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions, and enable the company to continue enhancing and promoting its sustainable brand. 

To achieve this, we will complete the following:
- Build a model to calculate the emissions across different variables and data inputs that exist within Darn Tough‚Äôs supply chain
- Develop an interactive application that allows users to visualize yearly emissions output
and interact/adjust factors that contribute to Darn Tough‚Äôs emissions
- Provide recommendations for reducing GHG emissions in Darn Tough's supply chain and improving its sustainability efforts.

This project is being compeleted as a Master's capstone project, working towards receiving a Master's of Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara.
